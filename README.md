# CoronaCast
A web application that aims to predict COVID-19 cases and deaths for US states.

## 05318 Human-AI Interaction F2020 Final Project at CMU
### Created by Dillan Gajarawala

CoronaCast has a very simple goal: To help users gain insight into what factors influence the number of COVID-19 cases
and deaths for different US states. Making a prediction is easy; Being able to show how it was made is the hard part.
CoronaCast tries to address this by using visual and text-based explanations to shed some light on a given COVID-19
case or death count prediction.
